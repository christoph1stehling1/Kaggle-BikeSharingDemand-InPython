In the course "Statistical Programming in Python", my group and I were tasked with competing in a Kaggle competition to predict the demand of shared bikes in Washington D.C.


Ant√≥nio Crespo de Carvalho, Cheer Hung, Utkarsh Khemka and I received the best grade for our work and it was selected as the best practice model for the subsequent Advanced Python course.
